# Project Diary

## What I want to add
- BNO055 IMU
- Pi Camera 3
- Jumper cables

## What I have added
- TF-Luna LiDAR scanner
- Raspberry Pi 5

## Notes
- Plan: assemble scanner system after the BNO055 IMU, Pi Camera 3, and jumper cables arrive.
- Software choice: Raspberry Pi will handle point-generation math, then send point data to Godot for visualization.
