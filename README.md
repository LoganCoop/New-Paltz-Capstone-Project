# New Paltz Capstone Project – LiDAR Scanner

## Project Ideas
**Date:** 1/21/2026

## Initial Idea
**LiDAR Scanner – Physical Computing**
- Raspberry Pi – Python or Arduino – C++
- Made for room scanning
- Environmental mapping
- Handheld and/or mobile
- 3D printed parts

## Overview
My current idea for the student-proposed project will be a LiDAR scanner that I will build and program myself. I want to use Arduino and/or Raspberry Pi parts for the hardware, as well as 3D printed parts to create housing for the Arduino components. I intend to write the software myself for the LiDAR mapping using the C++-based Arduino language, and/or using Python via a Raspberry Pi. As an add-on to this project, I'd like to make the scanner mobile if I have the time to do so, whether it is done via a drone or a handheld scanner. I believe that this project is a great blend of software and hardware and that it would be a great opportunity to develop my skills in combining both fields of technology. I personally have great experience with CAD and 3D printing, as well as all of the material I have covered during my time working on my computer science degree, so I believe this project would be a great way to improve and show my skills.

## Project Scope
1. **Coordinate Transformation:** Implementing the trigonometric algorithms necessary to map 1D distance readings into 3D space.
2. **Hardware-Software Integration:** Managing the “logic flow” between physical movement (motors) and data acquisition (sensors) to ensure sub-centimeter accuracy.
3. **Signal Processing:** Implementing filters to reduce sensor noise and handle “outlier” data points in complex environments.
4. **Mobility (Stretch Goal):** If time permits, the system will be adapted into a handheld form factor using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to allow for mobile scanning (SLAM – Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

## Timeline Layout
- **Phase 1:** Component testing and basic 2D mapping.
- **Phase 2:** Integration of the 2-axis gimbal and 3D data collection.
- **Phase 3:** Refinement of the visualization UI and final housing assembly.
